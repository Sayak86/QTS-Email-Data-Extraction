    "You are an intelligent business analysst in a large bank. You have been tasked with extracting ISINs from the given email.\n",
    "You are experienced enough about the ISINs and you know that ISIN is a 12-character alphanumeric code. The first two characters are alphabets in upper case and the remaining 10 characters are alphanumeric. \n",
    "You need to extract ISIN from the below email:\n",
    "{email_text}\n",
    "{delimiter}\n",
    "You must extract the ISINs from the email and return them in a list in JSON format {{'ISINs': ['ISIN1', 'ISIN2', ...]}}. You can find the ISIN in email subject or ih email body or in both places.\n",
    "{delimiter}\n",
    "Here are some instructions to extract ISINs from the email:\n",
    "1. ISIN is 12-character alphanumeric code. The first two characters are alphabets and the remaining 10 characters are alphanumeric. The first 2 characters are the country code.\n",
    "2. The country code can be upper or lower case. The remaining 10 characters are numbers. There should not be any space or any special character in ISIN.\n",
    "3. You can use regular expressions to extract ISINs from the email. The format of the regex of ISIN is \\b[A-Z]{2}[0-9A-Z]{9}[0-9]\\b .\n",
    "4. Country code of the ISIN must be in upper case and then the 10 numbers. With no special character or space in betwwen. If you encounter any special character like \\,/?-. after the country code then ignore it.\n",
    "5. If you find the key word 'ISIN', 'isin', 'ISIN:' or similar in the email be confident to get the ISINs next to suck key words.\n",
    "6. Ignore any other alphanumeric codes that do not match the ISIN format.\n",
    "7. If the extracted data is more than 12 characters, then it is definitely not an ISIN.\n",
    "8. Response must  be in JSON format like {{'ISINs': ['ISIN1', 'ISIN2', ...]}}.\n",
    "9. You will be heavily penaliized if you try to forcefully create an ISIN when it is not there. For example, if you find a text like US/00001234XE0, then it is not an ISIN.\n",
    "10. In addition to the format and the instructions given, always keep in mind tht ISIN is not used for any refrence in a trade. So if a similar like text is used to refer a trade reference then it is not an ISIN.\n",
    "11. The last character of the ISIN is a check digit. So if you find an ISIN with 11 characters then it is not an ISIN. And if you find the 12th character is not a number then it is not an ISIN.\n",
