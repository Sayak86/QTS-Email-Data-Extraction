Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\n\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \n\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\n"

Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\n\"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson, \na trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" \n\nBut the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\n\"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting,\" McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \nand culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \nfingers at Wall Street. \n\nStephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \nstepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for \nthe rise in gas prices. \n\n\"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik \ntold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \n\nIn California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \nutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \n\nCloser to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \nfor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \ncustomers and constituents from such price spikes. \n\nMost utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \nprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \ninsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \nprices before they soared. \n\n\"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul \nSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \n\nBut critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \n\n\"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \nchange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \nAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \n\n\nHot topic \n\nConsumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \nmany circles, little else is discussed. \n\nThe Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \nfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \nprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \nwell. \n\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n\n\"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n\nA year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \nthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \nto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \ncustomers. \n\nBut trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \ncubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \nfor winter. \n\nThere was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \nprices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \nAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \nbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n\nBut $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \nincluding the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \nmarkets. \n\n\"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n\nWholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \ntraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \ncommodity in the world. \n\n\nSetting the price \n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \ngas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \ncontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \nwidespread influence over gas prices. \n\nThe futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \nas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \nprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \nutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \nthey pay for the gas they expect to use. \n\nThere are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \nof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \nof natural gas. \n\nBut if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \nknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \nfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \ntheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \nin a short time. \n\nAs December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \nthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \nMuch of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \nweekly storage numbers. \n\nUtilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \nneed in the winter. \n\nGoing into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \naverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \nhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \n\nStill, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \nsufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \nconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n\nThen the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \nnumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \nassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n\nBut some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \npresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \ncontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n\n\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \n\nThen suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \nWednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \ndropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n\n\nJust passing through \n\nSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \npass their fuel costs on to customers. \n\nAmong area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \ncharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \nEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n\nSheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \nmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \nbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \nenergy. \n\nKansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \nsave an average customer about $25 this winter. \n\nMissouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \nextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \nguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n\nNow utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \ncustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \nthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \ncosts. \n\nOn Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \nCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \nperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \n\n\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider \nsome changes.\" \n\n\nTo reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \nseverly@kcstar.com. \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nAll content , 2001 The Kansas City Star  "
