1223-456 Transfer from 99999S1 to 66666S9 US912810QY73 US

Good morning

I tried to transfer above mentioned security from S1 to S9.
It is an instruction via Fedwire, but I dont manage to push the instructions which settle.
Last instructionbs were sent yesterday with our reference ref.PM/REC/111334/01 and PM/REC/8800765/01

Could you please help me with this?


Thanks
